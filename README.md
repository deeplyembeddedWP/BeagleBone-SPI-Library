# BeagleBone-SPI-Library

This is an SPI Library for the BeagleBone that consists of the API's to configure the loaded SPI device and perform full duplex SPI transactions. This Library has been tested to work in all the modes i.e. SPI_MODE0, SPI_MODE1, SPI_MODE2 and SPI_MODE3. At present, this Library only supports spidev1.0, however it can be extended to support other spidev1.x or spidev2.x as well.
